# Smart and Sustainable Irrigation
The objective of the system is to implement a smart irrigation system in azure cloud which switches on water systems based on current and future weather conditions thus saving water (Sustainability). The system also helps to monitor agricultural methane (Greenhouse gas) emissions and crop fires which are harmful for both crop and environment and this system also gives severe weather alerts one day prior to farmers so that they can save their dried produce and crops from rain.
